## Hi! My name is Rowan and Iâ€™m a scientist interested in better understanding how certain chemicals or compounds interact with the body and how these interactions can potentially affect health outcomes.
My expertise includes project design and management, data analysis and interpretation, and implementing collaborations across multidisciplinary groups. I have extensive laboratory knowledge in toxicology and molecular biology, including both "wet-lab" and computational analyses.      

## In my spare time I like to take photos, listen to/play music, and enjoy the outdoors.
